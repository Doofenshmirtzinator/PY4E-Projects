# PY4E-Projects
Programs/Functions I've written for "Scientific Computing with Python" course

Project 1: "Arithmetic Formatter"
  Function that arranges simple mathematical calculations in a vertical view. To run just call the function and as parameters type the equations e.g.:
  Input:
    arithmetic_arranger(["2501 + 242", "12 - 121", "4 + 1", "12 - 0", "10 - 2322"], True)
       
  You can add or remove True parameter to show or hide the solutions to the equations.

Project 2: "Time Calculator"
  It's under development. I hope to finish it by the end of the week.
